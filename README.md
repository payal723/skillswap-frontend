Welcome to the frontend of SkillSwap! This is a modern, attractive, and fully functional UI designed to simulate a real-world platform where users can offer their skills in exchange for skills they need. The entire interface is built with mock data, making it ready for a backend team to integrate APIs with minimal effort.

## 🎯 Core Goal

The primary objective of this project was to deliver a **fully working UI** that *looks and behaves* like the real application. All data is served from local mock files (`/src/data/mockData.js`), allowing the backend team to simply replace these data sources with live API calls.

## ✨ Features

-   **🎨 Stunning & Modern Design:** A visually appealing interface with smooth animations and a professional color palette.
-   **📱 Fully Responsive:** The UI looks and works great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   **🚀 Animated Splash Screen:** A loading animation to provide a professional user experience on startup.
-   **🏠 Home / Feed Page:**
    -   Displays "Skill Swap" posts from a local mock JSON file.
    -   Each post clearly shows what skills are being **offered** and what is being **sought**.
    -   Interactive cards with hover effects.
-   **👤 User Profile / My Account Page:**
    -   Displays mock user details (DP, bio, and top skills).
    -   Lists all posts created by that specific user.
-   **🔐 Login & Signup Pages (UI Only):**
    -   Beautifully designed forms for user registration and login.
    -   Ready for authentication logic to be integrated.
-   **➕ Create Post Modal:**
    -   An interactive modal form to create a new "Skill Swap" post.
    -   New posts are added to a temporary local state (`React.Context`), so the UI updates instantly, simulating a real-time experience.
-   **🧩 Clean & Reusable Components:** The code is structured into small, reusable components (like `Button`, `Modal`, `PostCard`), making it easy to maintain and scale.

## 🌟 Next Steps & Future Scope

This UI is the perfect foundation for a full-stack application. The next steps would be:

-   [ ] **Backend Integration:** Replace mock data fetches with actual API calls.
-   [ ] **Real Authentication:** Implement JWT or NextAuth for user login and signup.
-   [ ] **Database Connection:** Connect to a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user and post data.
-   [ ] **Real-time Chat:** Add a messaging feature for users to propose swaps and communicate.
-   [ ] **Advanced Filtering:** Enhance the sidebar with functionality to filter posts by specific skills.
